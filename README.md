Mostly, when I re-install my system, I have to set up a lot of things again and again.
For each tool I want to set up, I have to search a lot of articles (which usually don't get to the point immediately).
I had the idea to save all steps in one project called k-howto (Karim How To).
This way, I save time searching for the information and I can share it with those who are in need of short right-in-the-point tutorials.

Have Fun navigating these tutorials

Also, bring a fan because these are not cool tutorials; They are hot
