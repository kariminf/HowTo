A repository to save information on how to do things, like packaging in launchpad.

Why such project? Because I got bored from searching the web each time I want to create a package or do something.
Most of the articles are boring, long and not reaching to the point immediately.

* [Create a debian package](./deb-pack.md)
* [Create a package for launchpad](./ppa-pack.md)
