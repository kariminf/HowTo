# Install electron manually 

If the instruction 
`
npm install --save-dev electron
`
gives errors while trying to install electron before the download is completed, then you can install it manually. 

Go to [https://github.com/electron/electron/releases]() and download electron-version-system-arch.zip 

Also, download SHASUMS256.txt

## Linux

Go to ~/.electron/ and put the files there

Rename SHASUMS256.txt as SHASUMS256.txt-version 

Then, run the instruction again
